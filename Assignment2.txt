Arrays and Strings
1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
    String: Use when you have a fixed string value that doesn't change frequently.
        Ideal for small or immutable string operations, like concatenation of a few strings.
    StringBuilder:
        Use when you need to perform multiple string manipulations (like concatenation, insertion, removal) within a loop or in scenarios where performance is critical.
        More efficient for large or frequent string modifications because it doesn't create new string instances.
2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
    The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array.
3. How do you sort an array in C#?
    You can use the Array.Sort method.
4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
    The Length property can be used to get the total number of elements in an array.
5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    No, System.Array is a collection of elements that are of the same type. 
    However, you can store multiple data types if you declare the array as object[].
6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    CopyTo:
        Creates a shallow copy of the elements of one array to another existing array starting at a particular index.
        Shallow copy, meaning if the array contains references, only the references are copied, not the actual objects.
    Clone:
        Creates a shallow copy of the array and returns a new array object containing the same elements.
